# Vector DB

`VectorDB` is an abstract class. Your `VectorDB` subclass needs to define two methods: `_insert` and `_get_similar`.

<!-- In the `_insert` method, you need to tokenize the input text into a list of tokens. The tokens can be of any type.

To use your subclass, call the class instance like a function with the input text as the argument. -->
